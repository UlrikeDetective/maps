I like to combine Fuerteventura2025.py and travel_mapFuerteventura.ipynb. I like to have the style of the ipynb file with the markers (gps points) of the py file. How do I do this. Can you create a new jupyter notebook to accomplish that?

Okay, I will create a new Jupyter Notebook that combines the functionalities of Fuerteventura2025.py and travel_mapFuerteventura.ipynb. The new notebook will use osmnx to generate a base map and overlay the GPS points from the CSV file, similar to what Fuerteventura2025.py does.



Combined Functionality: The notebook now incorporates the base map generation from 
travel_mapFuerteventura.ipynb and the GPS point plotting from Fuerteventura2025.py.

Error Handling:** Includes a try-except block to handle TypeError during geocoding and a FileNotFoundError if the CSV file is missing.

GPS Point Overlay: The code reads the CSV file, filters out rows with missing coordinates, and plots the GPS points on the osmnx map. The transform=ax.transData.inverted() argument is crucial for plotting lat-lon coordinates on the map's axes.
File Paths: The CSV file path is hardcoded; you may need to adjust it.
Clearer Structure: The code is organized into cells for easy execution and modification.
Remember to install the required libraries (osmnx, matplotlib, pandas, folium) if you haven't already. You can install them using pip install osmnx matplotlib pandas folium. Also, make sure the CSV file path is correct.
